## Step #2 GitHub/Git

**Setup GitHub Repository for Jenkins Integration:**

GitHub serves as the repository from which Jenkins retrieves files to build, test, and build the infrastructure for the banking application and deploy the banking application.  

In order for the EC2 instance, where Jenkins is installed, to access the repository, you need to generate a token from GitHub and then provide it to the EC2 instance.

[Generate GitHub Token](https://github.com/LamAnnieV/GitHub/blob/main/Generate_GitHub_Token.md)




## Step # Docker

A Docker image is a template of an application with all the dependencies it needs to run. A docker file has all the components to build the Docker image.

For this deployment, we need to create a [dockerfile](dockerfile) to build the image of the banking application.  Please see the [GIT - docker file](Images/git.md) section to see how to test the dockerfile to see if it can build the image and if the image is deployable.


## Step # Terraform

Terraform is a tool that helps you create and manage your infrastructure. It allows you to define the desired state of your infrastructure in a configuration file, and then Terraform takes care of provisioning and managing the resources to match that configuration. This makes it easier to automate and scale your infrastructure and ensures that it remains consistent and predictable.

### Jenkins Agent Infrastructure

Use Terraform to spin up the [Jenkins Agent Infrastructure](jenkinsTerraform/main.tf) to include the installs needed for the [Jenkins instance](jenkinsTerraform/installs1.sh), the install needed for the [Jenkins Docker agent instance](jenkinsTerraform/installs2.sh), and the install needed for the [Jenkins Terraform agent instance](jenkinsTerraform/installs3.sh).

**Use Jenkins Terraform Agent to execute the Terraform scripts to create the Banking Application Infrastructure and Deploy the application on ECS with Application Load Balancer**

#### E-Commerce Application Infrastructure

Create the following [banking application infrastructure](intTerraform/vpc.tf):  

```
1 VPC
2 Availability Zones (AZ)
2 Public Subnets
2 Containers for the frontend
1 Container for the backend
1 Route Table
Security Group Ports: 8000, 3000, 80
1 ALB
```

#### Elastic Container Service (ECS)

Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a managed container orchestration service.  It is designed to simplify the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications using containers. The primary purpose of ECS with Docker images is to make it easier to run and manage containers in a scalable and reliable manner.

AWS Fargate is a technology that you can use with Amazon ECS to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters of Amazon EC2 instances. With Fargate, you no longer have to provision, configure, or scale clusters of virtual machines to run containers.

Create the following resource group for [Elastic Container Service](intTerraform/main.tf):  

```
aws_ecs_cluster - for grouping of tasks or services
aws_cloudwatch_log_group
aws_ecs_task_definition - describes the container
aws_ecs_service - is a fully managed opinionated container orchestration service that delivers the easiest way for organizations to build, deploy, and manage containerized applications at any scale on AWS
```

#### Application Load Balancer (ALB)

The purpose of an Application Load Balancer (ALB) is to evenly distribute incoming web traffic to multiple servers or instances to ensure that the application remains available, responsive, and efficient. It directs traffic to different servers to prevent overload on any single server. If one server is down, it can redirect traffic to the servers that are still up and running.  This helps improve the performance, availability, and reliability of web applications, making sure users can access them without interruption, even if some servers have issues.

Create the following [Application Load Balancer](intTerraform/ALB.tf):  

```
aws_lb_target_group - defines the target group
aws_alb" "bank_app - load balancer
aws_alb_listener - what port is the application load balancer listening on

```

## Step # Jenkins

**Jenkins**

Jenkins automates the Build, Test, and Deploy the Banking Application.  To use Jenkins in a new EC2, all the proper installs to use Jenkins and to read the programming language that the application is written in need to be installed. In this case, they are Jenkins, Java, and Jenkins' additional plugin "Pipeline Keep Running Step", which is manually installed through the GUI interface.

**Setup Jenkins and Jenkins nodes**

[Create](https://github.com/LamAnnieV/Create_EC2_Instance/blob/main/Create_Key_Pair.md) a Key Pair

Configure Jenkins

Instructions on how to install the [Docker Pipeline](https://github.com/LamAnnieV/Jenkins/blob/main/Install_Docker_Pipeline_Plugin.md)


## Step # Use Jenkins Terraform Agent to execute the Terraform scripts to create the Banking Application Infrastructure and Deploy the application on ECS with Application Load Balancer

Jenkins Build:  In Jenkins create a build "deploy_7" to run the file Jenkinsfilev for the Banking application from GitHub Repository []() and run the build.  This build consists of the "Test", the "Docker Build", "Login and Push", (Terraform) "Init", (Terraform) "Plan", and (Terraform) "Apply" stages.  

**Results:**
